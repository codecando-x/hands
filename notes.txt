while we recursively traverse the the data object once, we do the following things:
    - build a generated object hierarchy which one could access like(one.two.three.val),
        to get rid of the bracket access pattern
    - build a list of all key:val pairs which will enable direct lookup without recursing again
    - build a list of all access code snippets, mostly used for discovery to find out
        available keys deep in the object hierarchy, also for looking up value deep down
